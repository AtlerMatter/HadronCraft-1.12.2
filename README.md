HadronCraft Mod
=================
A Technology and electricity Mod for Minecraft 1.7.10
-----------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------

Adds new ores and ore processing, and also machines, some of which use electricity and others produce it.

Aims to also add some cool modern physics-related machinery like particle accelerators, nuclear reactors and more!

And, of course, your good old coal generator, solar panels and stuff like that

This mod uses Minecraft Forge and RedstoneFlux API

Youtube Page: [To be added]

This mod (should) be compatible with any mod that supports Redstone Flux API

Planned Features
----------------

Stop using RF and use my own take on watts, joules, volts and ohms, which will use realistic values and calculations

Ore processing things like the grinder, crusher, etc

Fission reactors and Fissile Fuel Processing

Some form of steam maybe, depending on how i go about doing the reactors

Fusion reactors: Magnetic Confinement Reactor, Inertial Confinement Reactor, etc

Particle Accelerators and Particle Colliders

In terms of resources: Antimatter, Strange Matter, Exotic Matter, Lead (and later mabe more stuff)

And much much more that i have planned!
