HadronCraft Mod
=================
A Technology and electricity Mod for Minecraft 1.12.2
-----------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------

Adds new ores and ore processing, and also machines, some of which use electricity and others produce it.

Aims to also add some cool modern physics-related machinery like particle accelerators, nuclear reactors and more!

And, of course, your good old coal generator, solar panels and stuff like that

This mod uses Minecraft Forge ~~and RedstoneFlux API~~

Youtube Page: [To be added]

This mod (should) [NOT] be compatible with any mod that supports Redstone Flux API (yet?)

Planned Features
----------------

[]Stop using RF and use my own take on watts, joules, volts and ohms, which will use realistic values and calculations

[]Ore processing things like the grinder, crusher, etc

[]Fission reactors and Fissile Fuel Processing

[]Some form of steam maybe, depending on how i go about doing the reactors

[]Fusion reactors: Magnetic Confinement Reactor, Inertial Confinement Reactor, etc

[]Particle Accelerators and Particle Colliders

[]In terms of resources: Antimatter, Strange Matter, Exotic Matter, Lead (and later mabe more stuff)

And much much more that i have planned!
